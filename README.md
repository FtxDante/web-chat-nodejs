# Web Chat: NodeJS with Websocket
This little project will be used just to show my skills with NodeJS. Probably this isn't the definitive version (1.0.0), the last version should use NestJS and Typecript (Obviously).

The documentation will be sent below, and in the swagger folder (will be present in the last version).
